# DictionarySpeak  ![DictionarySpeak](icons/48icon.png)
This is a small Chrome Extension which allows users to:  
1. Select a word from a webpage, and right click to pronounce/look up the word on Dictionary.com.
2. Choose pronounce/look up or both function in an option page.
3. Select a word from a webpage, and click on the extension button to see the definitions directly right away.  

Thus, it provides convenience to the users, as it saves the time on right clicking, searching on google and clicking on particular webpage. Note that the default word is "Hi", as I find it is more fun to add a greeting on the first page.
 
 
## Look up & Pronounce
Users have two ways to look up words. First, users can select a word, right click and select "What is this?". It will look up and/or pronounce the word depending on the custom option set on Option Page (See below). Another way to look up words will be to select a word and click on the extension button on the top right corner of Chrome task bar.

## Option Page:
Right click on the extension button. Select "Options". A popup page will show up. Select whether you want to look up words on the context menu (the menu when you right click on a word). You can choose whether it pronounces the word and/or look up the word on Dictionary.com. Note that it does not make sense to uncheck both buttons. Therefore, both will be selected if none of them is selected.
